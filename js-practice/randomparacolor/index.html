      Being Southerners, it was a source of shame to some members of the family
      that we had no recorded ancestors on either side of the Battle of
      Hastings. All we had was Simon Finch, a fur-trapping apothecary from
      Cornwall whose piety was exceeded only by his stinginess. In England,
      Simon was irritated by the persecution of those who called themselves
      Methodists at the hands of their more liberal brethren, and as Simon
      called himself a Methodist, he worked his way across the Atlantic to
      Philadelphia, thence to Jamaica, thence to Mobile, and up the Saint
      Stephens. Mindful of John Wesley's strictures on the use of many words in
      buying and selling, Simon made a pile practicing medicine, but in this
      pursuit he was unhappy lest he be tempted into doing what he knew was not
      for the glory of God, as the putting on of gold and costly apparel. So
      Simon, having forgotten his teacher's dictum on the possession of human
      chattels, bought three slaves and with their aid established a homestead
      on the banks of the Alabama River some forty miles above Saint Stephens.
      He returned to Saint Stephens only once, to find a wife, and with her
      established a line that ran high to daughters. Simon lived to an
      impressive age and died rich.
